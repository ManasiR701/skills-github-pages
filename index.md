**A black hole is a region in space with such strong gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape it.** This intense gravity is caused by an immense amount of mass compressed into a tiny space, often the result of a star's collapse at the end of its life. Black holes are **_invisible_** because light cannot escape, but their presence can be inferred by observing how they affect nearby matter, such as stars and gas.
